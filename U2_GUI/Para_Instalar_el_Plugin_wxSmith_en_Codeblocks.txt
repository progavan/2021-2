wxSmith is a Code::Blocks plugin for RAD editing of 
wxWidgets applications.

To install wxSmith on Linux if it is not already, simply install 
codebocks-contrib from your default repository (such as Ubuntu 
Software Center). This works even if you installed Code::Blocks 
from a 3rd party repository.
